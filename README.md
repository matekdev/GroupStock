# GroupStock

GroupStock is a stock watch list web application focused on providing users the
ability to create and manage stock watchlists.

The front-end interface was created using [React (MUI)](https://mui.com/). It makes API calls to the server running on [Express](https://expressjs.com/). The Express server uses [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to connect to a non-relational database.

## Stack

## Building

1. `npm install` in the root directory and inside of the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm dev` to startup both the Express server and the React client.
